# Wordpress Growkit

This is a work in progress, it's incomplete, weird and dummy in most places!
---

A special starter theme for special kind of developers, featuring super fast SASS/SCSS compilation using LibSass, custom options page and tools for creating the site right from the scratch. It has no predefined style and no layout. Instead, it bundles such things like Susy, Compass's Vertical Rhythm mixins and Modular Scale to let you build what you really want - if you like those tools like me, that is. 

INSTALLATION
---

Clone this repository to your `/wp-content/themes/` directory then run:

~~~~
npm install
bower install
~~~~

When the dependencies are installed run the grunt task to launch the live reload and compilation tasks.
